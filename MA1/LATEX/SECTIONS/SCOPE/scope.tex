The assignment at hand is to solve the integral equation
\[
\pi\phi(\bzhe) = \int_{\partial\Omega} \big( \phi\partial_{\nhat}\green - \green\partial_{\nhat}\phi \big) \,\dee S
\]
by numerical implementation, calculate the added mass, and compare the results to theoretical values.
The shapes to be considered are a circle, ellipses of aspect ratios $\sfrac{a}{b} = \sfrac{1}{2}$ and $\sfrac{a}{b} = \sfrac{1}{10}$, and a square.
As we shall need to consider the theoretical values of these shapes' added masses, these will be derived.
Although the lecture notes found in the repository in which this assignment is located already have an explanation of added mass, albeit rather heuristically inclined, a different approach will be taken for this assignment.
This assignment will furthermore function as documentation for the \texttt{Python}-code developed for the purpose of calculating added mass.
