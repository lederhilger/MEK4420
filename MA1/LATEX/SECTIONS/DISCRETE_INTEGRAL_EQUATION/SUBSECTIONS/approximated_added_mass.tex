Now having an approximation of $\bm{\phi}$, we may now approximate the integral in equation \eqref{eq:added_mass} as follows.
\[
    \addedmass = [m_{ij}] \approx \varrho \sum_{n = 1}^{N} {\phi_{j}}^{n} {\hat{n}}_{i}{}^{n} \delta S_{n}
\]
We are only interested in the substantive added mass, so we implement unit density.
The added mass is then implemented as the \texttt{added\_mass} method in the \texttt{IntegralEquation} class.
