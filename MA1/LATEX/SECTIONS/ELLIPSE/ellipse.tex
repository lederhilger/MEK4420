As with the circle, we will derive the analytical values for the added mass of an ellipse in motion.
This derivation, unlike the circle, is not straight forward.
And although we will employ the potential of the circle, elliptic coordinates will be introduced to transform this potential so that the ellipse can be studied.
Also unlike the circle, because of its shape, the ellipse will actually have added mass in the sixth mode.
