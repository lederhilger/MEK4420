Consider the complex variable defined as in equation \eqref{eq:elliptic_ezh}, with a potential
\[
w = i A e^{-2\zeta}, \qquad \Psi = Ae^{-2\zeta}\cos{2\eta},
\]
where $A$ is some parameter to be determined.
The stream function satisfies the condition that\footnote{\cite{kennard1967irrotational} \textsc{Kennard}, p.246}
\[
\Psi - \frac{\omega \big( x^2 + z^2 \big)}{2} = C,
\]
where $C$ is some constant.
We recall that $\ezh = x + iz$, so that
\[
A e^{-2\zeta} \cos{2\eta} - \frac{c^2 \omega \big( \cosh{2\xi} + \cos{2\eta} \big)}{4} = C.
\]
We evaluate this at the ellipse $\xi_0$, so that we eliminate $A$ and $\xi$, yielding
\[
w = \frac{i \omega {(a + b)}^2}{4 e^{2\zeta}}, \quad \Phi = \frac{\omega c^2 \sin{2\eta}}{4}.
\]
We may then again use the formulation of the kinetic energy of the fluid as it was presented in equation \eqref{eq:kinetic_energy_gauss}, noting that the differential element $\dee\Psi$ brings with a factor 2, yielding
\[
T_{\mathrm{fluid}} = \frac{\varrho \omega c^4}{16} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^{2}{2\eta} \,\dee\eta = \frac{\pi \varrho \omega c^4}{16}.
\]
