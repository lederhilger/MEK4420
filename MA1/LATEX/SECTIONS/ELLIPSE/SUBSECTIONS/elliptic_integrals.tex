To carry on with the analysis, we will need to introduce the elliptic integrals.
Although it will seem unmotivated to introduce them without much explanation as to what they represent, their applications will become clear in the following sections.
With that said, we introduce the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind,%
\footnote{\cite{abramowitz1965handbook} \textsc{Abramowitz} \& \textsc{Stegun}, eq.17.2.6, p.589}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:incomplete_elliptic_integral_first}
  \ellF(\varphi \vert k) = \int_{0}^{\varphi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2{\theta}}}\,\dee\theta
\end{equation}
The \emph{incomplete} denomination refers to the amplitude $\varphi$.
By setting $\varphi = \sfrac{\pi}{2}$, we have complete elliptic integral of the first kind,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:complete_elliptic_integral_first}
  \ellK(k) = \ellF(\sfrac{\pi}{2} \vert k) = \int_{0}^{\sfrac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2{\theta}}} \,\dee\theta
\end{equation}
We also have the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:incomplete_elliptic_integral_second}
  \ellE(\varphi \vert k) = \int_{0}^{\varphi} \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2{\theta}}\,\dee\theta,
\end{equation}
and the complete variant, which we will simply label $\ellE(k) \equiv \ellE(\sfrac{\pi}{2} \vert k)$.
We call $\kappa = k^2$ the parameter, and introduce the complementary parameter ${\kappa}^{\prime} = 1 - \kappa$---with it the notation that $\ellK^{\prime}(k) = \ellK(k^{\prime})$, and $\ellE^{\prime}(k) = \ellE(k^{\prime})$---$k$ is named the parameter and $k^{\prime} = \sqrt{\kappa^{\prime}}$ is its complement.

\textsc{Jacobi} introduced the following set of equations, upon writing $x = \ellF(\varphi \vert k)$ and $\varphi = \amplitudinis(x)$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:jacobi_sn_cn}
  \sn{x} = \sin{\varphi}, \qquad \cn{x} = \cos{\varphi};
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:jacobi_dn}
  \dn{x} = \sqrt{1 - k^2\sin^2{\varphi}}
\end{equation}
This set, and variations thereof, is simply referred to as \textsc{Jacobi} elliptic functions, and their individual names are \emph{sinus amplitudinis}, \emph{cosinus amplitudinis}, and \emph{delta amplitudinis}, respectively.
These functions will be explained further in later sections.
