# MEK4420
Course notes and assignments

## On the content
Shared are the notes compiled by Simon Lederhilger, based on the books _Marine Hydrodynamics_ by John Nicholas Newman and _Irrotational Flow of Frictionless Fluids, Mostly of Invariable Density_ by Earle Hesse Kennard.
This content is relevant to the special curriculum MEKSP100 _The response of wind turbines in waves_, supervised by Tor Anders Nygaard, consisting of three assignments:
* MA1: _Numerically determining added mass in an unbounded fluid_
* MA2: _The forces and response of a heaving rectangle_
* MA3: _The mooring dynamics of floating wind turbines_

Further development of the content will follow, with a focus on the theory leading up to the results of the three assignments.
