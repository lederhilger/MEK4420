# MEK4420
Notes and assignments based on those of the course [MEK4420 — _Marine Hydrodynamics_](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MEK4420/index-eng.html), taught at the University of Oslo.

## On the content
Shared are the notes compiled by Simon Lederhilger, based on the books _Marine Hydrodynamics_ by John Nicholas Newman, _Irrotational Flow of Frictionless Fluids, Mostly of Invariable Density_ by Earle Hesse Kennard, and _Methoden der Komplexen Funktionentheorie_ (originally in Russian: _Методы теории функций комплексного переменного_) by Michael Alekseyevich Lavrentev & Boris Vladimirovich Shabat.
This content is relevant to the special curriculum MEKSP100 _The response of wind turbines in waves_, supervised by Tor Anders Nygaard, consisting of four assignments:
* MA1: _Numerically determining added mass in an unbounded fluid_
* MA2: _The forces and response of a heaving rectangle_
* MA3: _The mooring dynamics of floating wind turbines_
* MA4: _Interaction between bodies and irregular sea_

Further development of the content will follow, with a focus on the theory leading up to the results of the three assignments.
