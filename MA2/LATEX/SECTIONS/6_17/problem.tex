A vertical spar buoy of circular cylindrical form, draft $T$, and diameter $d$ is freely floating.
Compute the hydrostatic restoring forces and moments.
Estimate the natural frequency in heave, assuming that the buoy is sufficiently slender that the added mass and dmaping coefficients can be neglected by comparison to the mass of the buoy.
Estimate the ecxiting force force from the \textsc{Froude}--\textsc{Krylov} approximation, the damping coefficient from the \textsc{Haskind} relations, and compute the heave response.
