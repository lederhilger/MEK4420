The far field amplitudes is shown to be
\[
    A_j^{\pm \infty} = \mp \int_{S_{\mathrm{B}}} \big( \kappa \phi_j \nhat^{\ast} - \hat{n}_j \big) \,\dee S.
\]
The added mass and damping coefficients are found by taking the real and imaginary parts of the integral
\[
    \int_{S_{\mathrm{B}}} \phi_j \hat{n} \,\dee S.
